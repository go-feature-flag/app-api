![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-%E2%9A%A0%EF%B8%8FWIP-red)

This repository is a work in progress initiative to create an API to manage your feature flags.

## Goals
- Create an API to manage your feature flags
- API should allow to add, modify and delete feature flags.
- Use a database to store the feature flags.
- This API is created to integrate a front end application to manage the feature flags.
- We should manage authentication and authorization to access the API.
  - Authentication should be generic enough to be integrated with any authentication provider.
- We should be able to provide history of a flag to see when it was created, modified and deleted.
